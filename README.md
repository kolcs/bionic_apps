# Bionic Applications

A Brain-Computer Interface and EEG & EMG signal processing tool.

## Description

This project is originally designed for the BCI discipline of the Cybathlon competition by the Ebrainers.

## Installation

1. Download git project
2. Download [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and install it.
3. Create a new environment called ''bci'' with python > 3.7 and < 3.11

   `conda create --name bci python=3.10`

4. activate environment

   `conda activate bci`

5. install requirements

   `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`
